Q. I have a file that's been modified. I want to discards the changes and revert the file back to what's in the source repository.
A. This can be done via the context menu "Replace with/File in Git index" on the file in package view.

Q.Git local commits mean fewer backups
If you have a private server with ssh access all you need to do is this:
	ssh my.server
	mkdir ~/repo.git && cd ~/repo.git
	git init --bare # bare repository that will serve as backup location
	exit
	# back on your box
	cd $my_local_git_repo
	git remote add --mirror backup ssh://my_server:repo.git
	git config remote.backup.fetch ":" # don't replace our data when
                                   # accidentally fetching from backup
	git push backup # copy everything new to backup repo
